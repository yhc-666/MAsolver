Efficiency comes from *early termination*—no need for full deduction when direct evidence exists.  \n**Rebuttal to FOL:** Rigor is preserved *and* optimized—CSP’s constraint graph shows \"kind\" is isolated with no dependencies. FOL’s formalism is overkill here."

Forward reasoning’s strength is *efficiency*—it stops at the first conclusive evidence (here, the direct statement). No need for constraint graphs or atomic propositions when the answer is staring us in the face.  \n**Key point:** Forward reasoning aligns with human intuition—if the problem says \"X is Y,\" and nothing contradicts it, we accept it.

Here, the contradiction is immediate, confirming the answer with mathematical certainty. No formalism is simpler or more definitive for binary truth claims.  \n**Key Advantage:** Unlike forward reasoning (which trusts premises) or CSP (which checks constraints), contradiction *proves* truth by falsifying the only alternative. Overkill? Perhaps—but *irrefutable*."
