The cat is not round.\n\nPlease discuss with other translators about parsing this problem, following these Rules of Discussion:\n\n1. **Syntax Verification**: Carefully review previous discussions to understand others' translations. While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

If Dave is smart and Dave is kind then Dave is quiet.\nQuestion: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? Charlie is kind.\n\nPlease discuss with other translators about parsing this problem, following these Rules of Discussion:\n\n1. **Syntax Verification**: Carefully review previous discussions to understand others' translations. While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

The cat is not round.\n\nPlease discuss with other translators about parsing this problem, following these Rules of Discussion:\n\n1. **Syntax Verification**: Carefully review previous discussions to understand others' translations. While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"

While maintaining YOUR OWN symbolic language system, check and correct any syntax errors in your translation (e.g., unclosed parentheses, malformed expressions).\n\n2. **Completeness Check**: Review others' translations to understand their interpretation of the natural language problem. While keeping YOUR OWN symbolic language system, verify and correct the information completeness of your translation (no missing/extra facts, rules, predicates, or statements from the original problem).\n\n3. **Language Independence**: When referencing others' translations, you MUST maintain your own symbolic language system. DO NOT adopt symbols or syntax from other languages (e.g., LP uses \">>>\", FOL uses \"→\", SAT uses \"==\" - never mix these).\nHere is your discussion history:"
