Cold, smart things are red: ∀x, (cold(x) ∧ smart(x)) → red(x)\n4. And others...\nFrom the context, we know Charlie is quiet, red, and rough. Since all quiet things are rough (rule 1), and rough implies cold (rule 2), Charlie must be cold. Then, since Charlie is cold and red, and red things are rough (given), but we already have that.\nCrucially, we're asked: \"Charlie is kind?\" From the given facts, Charlie is explicitly stated as kind. The context says: \"Charlie is kind.\" This is a direct fact, not derived.\nTherefore, the statement \"Charlie is kind\" is true by direct assertion.
